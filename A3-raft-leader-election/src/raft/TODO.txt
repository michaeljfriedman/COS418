Bugs

* RPCs not working
* RequestVote() and AppendEntries() RPCs only call to server 2, and election is never won
  * Fix RequestVote RPCs so they call to different servers (they are currently all going to same server)
  * Fix no one wins election
    * Have determined from [3] that a candidate is receiving vote replies from all servers (see err.txt).
    * Check that servers are actually granting votes for the candidate
    * Election corner cases:
      * 1: Make sure term & votedFor are in sync, so that if I vote for someone, I can't vote again unless the election is for a later term
      * 2: If there's a re-election, it's possible for two candidates to be running in different terms. Add another possible election outcome for "stale election", which happens when a server realizes he's running in an outdated election. In this case he should stop his candidacy and vote for whoever he gets a request from in the new election.
    * Same problem with RPCs again (not going to different servers), but this time for AppendEntries
