COS 418 Assignments (Fall 2017)

## Overview and setup

The assignments in this course are written in Go. Each assignment is in its own directory, and on its own branch. See the assignment branches for the submitted version of that assignment as well as version history. (Note that this repository does not make use of the "master" branch.)
