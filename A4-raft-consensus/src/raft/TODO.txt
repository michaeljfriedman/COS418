Part I - Appending log entries and reaching consensus
-----------------------------------------------------

>>> Write in debug print statements as you go!


* Implement data types
  * Raft
    * Lock-able commitIndex/lastApplied (lock the whole Raft obj)
  * LogEntry
  * AppendEntriesArgs
  * AppendEntriesReply

* Implement Start(), "when I become leader" (easy)

* Interlude: Make separate debug flag for leader election and consensus

* Interlude: if log is indexed from 1, make sure first commit works

* Implement leader functions:
  * doConsensus()
  * applyLogEntries()
  * sendAppendEntries()  (overwrites old sendAppendEntries)
  * sendPeriodicHeartbeats()

* Implement follower functions:
  * AppendEntries()
  * logsMatchThrough()

- Debug tests:
  * TestBasicAgree
  * TestFailAgree
  - TestFailNoAgree
    - See err3-no-leader-elected.txt
  - TestConcurrentStarts
  - TestRejoin
  - TestBackup
  - TestCount
  - Remove AppendEntriesArgs Id attr and Raft appendEntriesId attr before moving on (?)

- Fix leader election bug?
  - At one point I got a failure in the second leader election test (from A3),
    where server 0 claimed to be leader even though no leader should have been
    elected... but this only happened once and never happened again. Weird...
